        <h1>European Project Semester</h1>
        <section>
        <p>European Project Semester (<i>EPS</i>) is a programme offered by several European universities to students
            who have completed at least two years of study.
            <br> EPS is created with engineering students in mind, 
            but other students who can participate in an engineering project are also welcome.</p>
        </section>
        <h3>EPS is a mixture of “Project Related Courses” and project organized/problem based learning. <br>
            It is crafted to address the design requirements of the degree <br>
            and prepare engineering students with all the necessary skills to face the challenges of
            today’s world economy. <br> Students work in international and interdisciplinary teams of 
            3–6 students on their projects. <br> Projects are done in cooperation with commercial
            businesses and industries or with research centers. <br> There are minor differences
            between EPS-projects and the various EPS-providers, <br> but all providers have agreed
            about the following key elements.</h3>
